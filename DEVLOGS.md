# Devlogs  
This file contains devlogs. Some features shown in them may arrive a few months after its first publication.  
**Remember that we are only 3 people working on the mod. And we all have lives besides the mod.** I (Lumaa) am not a professional Java developer, I really started learning by creating this mod.  
<sup>(btw we use this date format: DD/MM/YYYY)</sup>  

# Devlog #13 - 25/08/2024
**It's back.** The Backrooms Mod has officially restarted development! But why did it take **9 months** to release the mod fully and to the latest version?

Because I (Lumaa) originally "retired" from Minecraft modding to go make [iOS apps](https://apps.lumaa.fr/?utm_source=BckrmGitHub) like [Threaded]((https://apps.lumaa.fr/app/threaded?utm_source=BckrmGitHub)), so then [Clomclem](https://github.com/Clomclem) managed the mod by himself. And then at some point, we had no news from him nor updates to the mod. So we thought he did just like I did (retiring) without saying anything. That's where I thought the mod would slowly die..\
But oh boy was I wrong, we passed 10k and 20k downloads on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/backrooms)! And the mod turned 2 years old!

The original location of The Backrooms image has been found in July 2024 as well as [more photos from the original photographer](https://archive.org/details/backrooms-photos/807OREGON/DSC00161.jpg)!, and I (Lumaa) thought that so many more stuff could be added to this mod! But we should also update to the latest version of Minecraft, which is currently 1.21...

I opened the project and while updating, I realized that 99.99% of the code was to refactor. So instead of UPDATING the code, I RESTARTED the project. Well, almost. I kept everything that was easy to update, like blocks, items, creative tabs, and other stuff...

[PatateGivree](https://github.com/Minipinot) helped me do the new blocks like the *Moist Silk Cherry Planks* or the *Blue Tapestry*, and he **MAJORLY** helped me by doing **himself** the custom generation using jigsaw blocks. And that deserves more than a pat on the back.

Oh and the [GitBook Wiki](https://lumaa.gitbook.io/backrooms) is up to date.

# Devlog #12 - 4/12/2023
Hello everyone, we've just reached 5200 downloads! Not actually that big, but its still impressive that we got 200 downloads in ~2 days. As a reward, here's what I've been working on:

**A sanity system**

Are you tired of wandering the Backrooms endlessly, and only losing your RL sanity? Well now you can lose it in game.
This mechanic will add a system in which you will slowly lose your sanity while in the Backrooms, which will at some point give you debuffs if your sanity is low enough and even kill you.
But do not fear, because Almond Water quickly fixes this issue (temporally).

We've also added a new and *shiny* config menu, which will allow you to configure many things such as how you can enter the Backrooms, how fast your sanity drains & much more.

I'm also planning on adding Level Run, which will be as expected, but only a few entities will follow you for now.

That's all, See ya!

# Devlog #11 - 18/11/2023
Hello everyone, this is Clomclem talking, I'm the new maintainer/developer of this mod, so feel free to ask me anything.
We've finally added Level 0 worldgen, though right now it's pretty bland, so any suggestions would be appreciated. There's also a bunch of new translations (Russian by mpustovoi, Spanish by Clomclem), so that's cool.
There are many buxfixes in the latest release, but there are still many unnoticed bugs, so feel free to open an issue if you find one.
Also, we're looking for ideas for new levels and entities, so feel free to post your idea on the [Support Discord](https://discord.gg/Rqpn3C7yR5).
That's all, see ya!

# Devlog #10 - 11/05/2023
Hello everyone, this devlog won't have any introduction sadly because this devlog is a section of my main devlog I did on my [Support Discord](https://discord.gg/Rqpn3C7yR5), in the "Devlogs" channel.\
There has been an unknown bug that popped during my moving when the game launches, [I opened an issue already on GitHub](https://github.com/lumaa-dev/BackroomsMod/issues/14), you can see there yourself. There is also the 1k downloads coming very very soon, I also said many times there would be a surprise at the 1k milestone. But during the production of the suprise, one of the persons that was working on it with us left us without saying anything. Therefore we might have a delay, and we're sorry.

# Devlog #9 - 20/03/2023
Wow it's been a month...  
What are we up to? Well first, WE *almost* FIXED THE RADIO!! It plays music now, and it works. Well the very few amount of bugs are due to stopping sounds in singleplayer worlds which sucks btw but I have to. The second bug is that when you stop the radio and start using it again, it doesn't actually starts from zero (apart from the caption). So yeah

I've also been moving as I said on my [Support Discord](https://lumaa.brebond.com/support) (consider joining it there are polls and stuff you'd be happy to join) and I didn't really get a lot of time working on mods lately so I'll try my best.  
Anyway I still have business to do...

# Devlog #8 - 21/02/2023
You surely have seen it, the first beta released! I'm super proud to finally give you the [Beta A0.1.0](https://modrinth.com/mod/backrooms/version/B-A0.1.2).  
This will be a small devlog considering I released the Beta, but consider joining the [Support Discord](https://lumaa.brebond.com/support), follow the mod on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/backrooms) and star the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/lumaa-dev/BackroomsMod)! And thank you again for all the support throughout the development of the [Beta A0.1.0](https://modrinth.com/mod/backrooms/version/B-A0.1.2)!

# Devlog #7 - 13/02/2023
Happy news I think. So, if you read the [last devlog](https://github.com/lumaa-dev/BackroomsMod/blob/main/DEVLOGS.md#devlog-65---05022023) I said thate there would no longer be devlogs in February but hey, good news, there will be. Don't asked me why I'm so confused but now you have devlogs coming.

Anyway, now the mod. I added the Level 1 blocks and named them, I still can't make the Radio Block work so it will probably not be in **Beta A0.1.0**. And I'm still relentlessly coding on the [MazeCore](https://github.com/lumaa-dev/LibuLib/blob/298e5cae61655dc199ad77d8fbe121aac7aef78f/src/main/java/com/lumaa/libu/generation/MazeCore.java) for the Backrooms Level 0 generation, and it goes very well!! Look at the following image to see the progression.

# Devlog #6.5 - 05/02/2023
Okay so, this devlog is some sort of update from the last one I guess. Let me explain:  
I never said it publicly but I'm moving out soon, and that means that I have much less time to work on the mod or other projects such as LibuLib or keeping my socials active for a while. I said multiple times that the first beta "will" release before March 2023, but I cannot hold that promise anymore.  
Sorry if I disappointed some people, but again, I'm the only person (Lumaa) coding the mod, PatateGivr√©e only makes the assets and Luvaa gives from time to time, music recommendations for music tapes or radio songs.

What I will guarantee, is to release **Beta A0.1.0** as soon as possible, after March 2023.

Little side-note here: This is, and will be, the only devlog of February. So see you then, and remember, __peace n love__.

# Devlog #6 - 30/01/2023
New devlog, yeepee!  
Before even starting this devlog, I wanna say a very **VERY** big thank you for **300 downloads on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/backrooms)!** This number is incredibly large and it all feels unreal, I saw it in while I was eating and cheered in public lol, this is big and all but you haven't seen the Beta yet. Because yes, the beta is coming but read the whole thing I'll talk about it in there. But yeah, 300 downloads and still going up. I hope me, PatateGivree and Luvaa can make you enjoy Minecraft even more using our mod and that the updates will make you more and more excited for what's coming.

So, what are we up to? Might've noticed that we are trying REALLY HARD to make code-generated Backrooms (using [LibuLib](https://github.com/u-lumaa/LibuLib)'s newest [MazeCore](https://github.com/u-lumaa/LibuLib/blob/140b401df17f0a6485f4aef7456f58ed1b0abb09/src/main/java/com/lumaa/libu/generation/MazeCore.java)). It is really hard, not gonna lie. It's hard doing multiple things at once lol, doing YouTube videos (editing and thumbnail included), Twitch streams, and coding. But this mod is probably the thing that I've been coding the longest in my entire life. Anyways I'm drifting from the topic.  
I continued the code-generated Backrooms, I tried once more fixing the Radio Block but failed once again, we added little stuff such as a "Missing LibuLib" screen, Generation Core item to generate the Level 0 Backrooms (this is temporary but it's cool), we also planned a few things for the future relating to Kane Pixels' Backrooms so watch out, and, big thing here, we added the [Level 1](http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-1) blocks and dimension in the mod, its portal will be added when we'll have a solid idea of it.

Now the biggest thing since the creation of the mod, passing Alpha and going to a Beta. It also feels unreal, maybe for you too, but I've been working on this relentlessly and finally saying this releases so much pain about bugs and glitches. So yes, there won't be an Alpha A0.0.5, but a **Beta A0.1.0**.  
I wanna point out that after I release the Beta I'll get off the mod for a bit, I'll still read suggestions on my Discord, issues on the GitHub, and check the download count on Modrinth. But for a undetermined amount of time I'll stop coding the BackroomsMod (for my own sanity and mental health lol).

Anyways, that was a lot for one devlog, so I'll see you on the next one. With, hopefully, good news!

# Devlog #4 - 16/01/2023
Happy new year and welcome!  
I was very tempted to write a Devlog last week but finally, I didn't. Why? Before saying why, let me put you in the context:  
I began streaming (in French) just a few hours away of 2023, only problem is that I am a developer not a gamer, so, I stream the BackroomsMod development on [my Twitch](https://twitch.tv/u_Lumaa_). Most of the streams will be in French but if you wanna come around and talk to me in English, you totally can! (We'd actually be glad lmao).  
As I'm writing this, we currently have 269 downloads on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/backrooms), and I never got to do it but **thank you very much** to everyone that downloaded the mod. All this went really quick and we hit 100 and 200 downloads really soon! Some mods have this chance like ours and some others have less chance, this was just supposed to be a little project and now it's at its biggest. So thank you for the 6 first months of The Backrooms Mod!!

*PS: I promise to release the Beta A0.1.0 before March 2023*

# Devlog #3 - 28/12/2022
Hey hey.  
Quick devlog here to talk about the radio block we talked about in the [first Devlog](#devlog-1---08122022). So now, it's a total solid idea and it will be added in. AND (very important), we were allowed to use any music made by [Good Kid](https://youtube.com/@GoodKidband)! They've allowed us to use any of their musics in our mod for some credit.  
You maybe don't know who they are so you maybe can check them out!

Also while I'm at it, we have a big issue with LibuLib and will (definitely) not release for Alpha A0.0.5. Stay tuned for it though it's coming really soon <3

# Devlog #2 - 18/12/2022
Hello again!  
This devlog is kind of unexpected for me since I said that this devlog was supposed to release in 2023, but if you haven't seen it, we shown in [REPOS.txt](https://github.com/u-lumaa/BackroomsMod/commit/b119e92bc9718a83fbcd33e0090ab7934cd72df5) my newest creation. **LibuLib**. It is, for now, my personal Minecraft library (I'll see in the future if I ever open source **LibuLib**). Why did I do this? Well first, I made it to not repeat code in projects, here's an example: [Your Name Your Death's Colors.java](https://github.com/u-lumaa/your-name-your-death/blob/main/src/main/java/com/lumaa/ynyd/utils/Colors.java) and [The Backrooms Mod's Colors.java](https://github.com/u-lumaa/BackroomsMod/blob/541ef3e3764cf9249e5c9d495d78751edb26aec2/src/main/java/com/lumination/backrooms/utils/Colors.java) are the 2 same files.  
After implementing **LibuLib**. I'll just have to import the `Colors.java` from **LibuLib**. But there will be more in the future.
 
Since [last time](#devlog-1---08122022), I fixed the Tape Player's hitbox, we reverted back to 1.19.1, the radio has been remodeled and retextured, and the original songs will come much much later in 2023. And I (almost) began working on the Level 0's labyrinth. (Fun fact: Internally, we made a lot of notes on "How can we achieve this" using Apple's latest app "[Freeform](https://apps.apple.com/app/freeform/id6443742539)" on iOS, iPadOS and macOS)
 
Thank you everyone for reading this **<3**

# Devlog #1 - 08/12/2022
First devlog, wooo!  
What have we been on working on? We've been trying to make the Bacteria work again, but we still fail relentlessly. We also updated the mod in 1.19.2 because of GeckoLib being inexistant in 1.19.1. But now the Tape Player lost his custom hitbox, and I don't know how to fix it lol.  
We have **songs being made** just for our mod by PatateGivree, it will be a music tape. We also thought of making a radio, when you right click on it, it scrolls through all the music tapes (without using tapes). It's been thought of and modeled, but it's unknown if it's really an idea to consider.  

I sadly still have not found a way to generate the Level 0's labyrinth. I thought of something that may work, but it's an idea, and an hard-coded way
