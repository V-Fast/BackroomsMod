# Devlogs  
This file contains devlogs. Some features shown in them may arrive a few months after its first publication.  
**Remember that we are only 3 people working on the mod. And we all have lives besides the mod.** I (Lumaa) am not a professional Java developer, I really started learning by creating this mod.  
<sup>(btw we use this date format: DD/MM/YYYY)</sup>

# Devlog #8 - 21/02/2023
You surely have seen it, the first beta released! I'm super proud to finally give you the [Beta A0.1.0](https://modrinth.com/mod/backrooms/version/BETA-A0.1.0).  
This will be a small devlog considering I released the Beta, but consider joining the [Support Discord](https://lumaa.brebond.com/support), follow the mod on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/backrooms) and star the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/lumaa-dev/BackroomsMod)! And thank you again for all the support throughout the development of the [Beta A0.1.0](https://modrinth.com/mod/backrooms/version/BETA-A0.1.0)!

# Devlog #7 - 13/02/2023
Happy news I think. So, if you read the [last devlog](https://github.com/lumaa-dev/BackroomsMod/blob/main/DEVLOGS.md#devlog-65---05022023) I said thate there would no longer be devlogs in February but hey, good news, there will be. Don't asked me why I'm so confused but now you have devlogs coming.

Anyway, now the mod. I added the Level 1 blocks and named them, I still can't make the Radio Block work so it will probably not be in **Beta A0.1.0**. And I'm still relentlessly coding on the [MazeCore](https://github.com/lumaa-dev/LibuLib/blob/298e5cae61655dc199ad77d8fbe121aac7aef78f/src/main/java/com/lumaa/libu/generation/MazeCore.java) for the Backrooms Level 0 generation, and it goes very well!! Look at the following image to see the progression.

# Devlog #6.5 - 05/02/2023
Okay so, this devlog is some sort of update from the last one I guess. Let me explain:  
I never said it publicly but I'm moving out soon, and that means that I have much less time to work on the mod or other projects such as LibuLib or keeping my socials active for a while. I said multiple times that the first beta "will" release before March 2023, but I cannot hold that promise anymore.  
Sorry if I disappointed some people, but again, I'm the only person (Lumaa) coding the mod, PatateGivrée only makes the assets and Luvaa gives from time to time, music recommendations for music tapes or radio songs.

What I will guarantee, is to release **Beta A0.1.0** as soon as possible, after March 2023.

Little side-note here: This is, and will be, the only devlog of February. So see you then, and remember, __peace n love__.

# Devlog #6 - 30/01/2023
New devlog, yeepee!  
Before even starting this devlog, I wanna say a very **VERY** big thank you for **300 downloads on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/backrooms)!** This number is incredibly large and it all feels unreal, I saw it in while I was eating and cheered in public lol, this is big and all but you haven't seen the Beta yet. Because yes, the beta is coming but read the whole thing I'll talk about it in there. But yeah, 300 downloads and still going up. I hope me, PatateGivree and Luvaa can make you enjoy Minecraft even more using our mod and that the updates will make you more and more excited for what's coming.

So, what are we up to? Might've noticed that we are trying REALLY HARD to make code-generated Backrooms (using [LibuLib](https://github.com/u-lumaa/LibuLib)'s newest [MazeCore](https://github.com/u-lumaa/LibuLib/blob/140b401df17f0a6485f4aef7456f58ed1b0abb09/src/main/java/com/lumaa/libu/generation/MazeCore.java)). It is really hard, not gonna lie. It's hard doing multiple things at once lol, doing YouTube videos (editing and thumbnail included), Twitch streams, and coding. But this mod is probably the thing that I've been coding the longest in my entire life. Anyways I'm drifting from the topic.  
I continued the code-generated Backrooms, I tried once more fixing the Radio Block but failed once again, we added little stuff such as a "Missing LibuLib" screen, Generation Core item to generate the Level 0 Backrooms (this is temporary but it's cool), we also planned a few things for the future relating to Kane Pixels' Backrooms so watch out, and, big thing here, we added the [Level 1](http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/level-1) blocks and dimension in the mod, its portal will be added when we'll have a solid idea of it.

Now the biggest thing since the creation of the mod, passing Alpha and going to a Beta. It also feels unreal, maybe for you too, but I've been working on this relentlessly and finally saying this releases so much pain about bugs and glitches. So yes, there won't be an Alpha A0.0.5, but a **Beta A0.1.0**.  
I wanna point out that after I release the Beta I'll get off the mod for a bit, I'll still read suggestions on my Discord, issues on the GitHub, and check the download count on Modrinth. But for a undetermined amount of time I'll stop coding the BackroomsMod (for my own sanity and mental health lol).

Anyways, that was a lot for one devlog, so I'll see you on the next one. With, hopefully, good news!

# Devlog #4 - 16/01/2023
Happy new year and welcome!  
I was very tempted to write a Devlog last week but finally, I didn't. Why? Before saying why, let me put you in the context:  
I began streaming (in French) just a few hours away of 2023, only problem is that I am a developer not a gamer, so, I stream the BackroomsMod development on [my Twitch](https://twitch.tv/u_Lumaa_). Most of the streams will be in French but if you wanna come around and talk to me in English, you totally can! (We'd actually be glad lmao).  
As I'm writing this, we currently have 269 downloads on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/backrooms), and I never got to do it but **thank you very much** to everyone that downloaded the mod. All this went really quick and we hit 100 and 200 downloads really soon! Some mods have this chance like ours and some others have less chance, this was just supposed to be a little project and now it's at its biggest. So thank you for the 6 first months of The Backrooms Mod!!

*PS: I promise to release the Beta A0.1.0 before March 2023*

# Devlog #3 - 28/12/2022
Hey hey.  
Quick devlog here to talk about the radio block we talked about in the [first Devlog](#devlog-1---08122022). So now, it's a total solid idea and it will be added in. AND (very important), we were allowed to use any music made by [Good Kid](https://youtube.com/@GoodKidband)! They've allowed us to use any of their musics in our mod for some credit.  
You maybe don't know who they are so you maybe can check them out!

Also while I'm at it, we have a big issue with LibuLib and will (definitely) not release for Alpha A0.0.5. Stay tuned for it though it's coming really soon <3

# Devlog #2 - 18/12/2022
Hello again!  
This devlog is kind of unexpected for me since I said that this devlog was supposed to release in 2023, but if you haven't seen it, we shown in [REPOS.txt](https://github.com/u-lumaa/BackroomsMod/commit/b119e92bc9718a83fbcd33e0090ab7934cd72df5) my newest creation. **LibuLib**. It is, for now, my personal Minecraft library (I'll see in the future if I ever open source **LibuLib**). Why did I do this? Well first, I made it to not repeat code in projects, here's an example: [Your Name Your Death's Colors.java](https://github.com/u-lumaa/your-name-your-death/blob/main/src/main/java/com/lumaa/ynyd/utils/Colors.java) and [The Backrooms Mod's Colors.java](https://github.com/u-lumaa/BackroomsMod/blob/541ef3e3764cf9249e5c9d495d78751edb26aec2/src/main/java/com/lumination/backrooms/utils/Colors.java) are the 2 same files.  
After implementing **LibuLib**. I'll just have to import the `Colors.java` from **LibuLib**. But there will be more in the future.
 
Since [last time](#devlog-1---08122022), I fixed the Tape Player's hitbox, we reverted back to 1.19.1, the radio has been remodeled and retextured, and the original songs will come much much later in 2023. And I (almost) began working on the Level 0's labyrinth. (Fun fact: Internally, we made a lot of notes on "How can we achieve this" using Apple's latest app "[Freeform](https://apps.apple.com/app/freeform/id6443742539)" on iOS, iPadOS and macOS)
 
Thank you everyone for reading this **<3**

# Devlog #1 - 08/12/2022
First devlog, wooo!  
What have we been on working on? We've been trying to make the Bacteria work again, but we still fail relentlessly. We also updated the mod in 1.19.2 because of GeckoLib being inexistant in 1.19.1. But now the Tape Player lost his custom hitbox, and I don't know how to fix it lol.  
We have **songs being made** just for our mod by PatateGivree, it will be a music tape. We also thought of making a radio, when you right click on it, it scrolls through all the music tapes (without using tapes). It's been thought of and modeled, but it's unknown if it's really an idea to consider.  

I sadly still have not found a way to generate the Level 0's labyrinth. I thought of something that may work, but it's an idea, and an hard-coded way
